    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I am a learning developer who aspires to broaden my web developing skills by practicing daily, I love web developing; every key stroke on VS code gives me a satisfaction of joy. Being a part of a community that only advances in technology daily makes me more closer towards developing website</p>
    <h2>Qualifications:</h2>
    <pi>Suprisingly, I dont have much qualifications in coputer science, this is my first cornerstone project and this website is only for making a practice portfolio hopefully to look months or years later and be proud of where I am now. I have a qualification from a medical practicioner building my CV for medical school hopefully, this web development not only is a passion but also a financial means to support my self and others.</pi>
    <h2>Goals and aspirations</h2>
    <p>As mentioned in the qualification section, I want to learn HTML, Javascript, React.js and CSS in order to pursue my aspirations in web developing. My goals is to support myself during my medical school years financialy while also working comfortably at home rather than working publicaly, and or to make money for the people I care about the most.</p>
    <q2>Small message from the developer:</q2>
    <p>Hey! I want to mention, if you are viewing this then this is a long long long start from a very longer jounrey in web development. I hope I can look back a year or months later and feel proud in myself that a £58 investment turned into not only skills and qualifications but actual monitised passions to make money! <br> <br> And will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah, then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has already set for everything a [decreed] extent. <br> <br> "Inherited Will, The Destiny Of Age, The Dreams Of Its People. As Long As People Continue To Pursue The Meaning Of Freedom, These Things Will Never Cease!" </p>
